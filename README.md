## Description
The Hangman Game is a Python-based console game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The aim of the project is to provide an interactive and entertaining game while showcasing fundamental Python programming concepts.

### What it does
- Allows the player to guess letters to reveal a hidden word.
- Tracks the number of lives remaining for the player.
- Provides feedback on the correctness of the guesses.

### Aim of the Project
The project aims to demonstrate:
- Object-oriented programming in Python.
- User input handling and validation.
- Basic game logic and flow control.
- Modular code structure.

### What I Learned
During this project, I learned:
- How to design and implement a simple console-based game.
- The importance of user input validation.
- How to structure code using classes and methods.

## Installation
To play the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd hangman-game
    ```
3. Run the game script.
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

## Usage
- Upon running the script, the game will prompt you to guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
- Enter a single alphabetical character as your guess and press Enter.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to continue playing.
